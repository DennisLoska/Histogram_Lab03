The Leipzig Corpora Collection presents corpora in different languages using the same format and comparable sources. All data are available as plain text files and can be imported into a MySQL database by using the provided import script. They are intended both for scientific use by corpus linguists as well as for applications such as knowledge extraction programs.
The corpora are identical in format and similar in size and content. They contain randomly selected sentences in the language of the corpus and are available in sizes from 10,000 sentences up to 1 million sentences. The sources are either newspaper texts or texts randomly collected from the web. The texts are split into sentences. Non-sentences and foreign language material was removed. Because word co-occurrence information is useful for many applications, these data are precomputed and included as well. For each word, the most significant words appearing as immediate left or right neighbor or appearing anywhere within the same sentence are given.
The corpora are automatically collected from carefully selected public sources without considering in detail the content of the contained text. No responsibility is taken for the content of the data. In particular, the views and opinions expressed in specific parts of the data remain exclusively with the authors.
